## Directories and marketplaces
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) — hundreds of free webfonts hosted via Google or self-hosted, downloadable via [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/fonts) with individual licenses
- [MyFonts](http://myfonts.com) — thousands of fonts from all kinds of foundries, includes some trial fonts & free families. (good for searching and testing, but it's better to buy through the foundries themselves!)
